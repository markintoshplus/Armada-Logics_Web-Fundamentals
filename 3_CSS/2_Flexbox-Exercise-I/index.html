<!-- Reflection 
    For this challenge, my approach is going through each of the elements and arranging them in order of appearance.
    One of the struggles I faced is knowing what is the appropriate code to use that causes the certain element to appear like that.
    What I did is I referred back to the course materials about the properties of a flexbox to solve my problem.-->
